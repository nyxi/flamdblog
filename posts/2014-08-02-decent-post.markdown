Here is a short example post with a *read more* button and a code highlight example:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python

def hw():
    print 'Hello world!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hw()
```
<!--more-->
And here is some more text, only visible in when the entire post is viewed.

Just trying some code in the body too:

```py
def hw():
    print 'Hello world!'
```

See!
